      "Abstract": "SmaCC (Smalltalk Compiler-Compiler) is a freely available parser generator for Smalltalk. It generates LR parsers and is a replacement for the T-Gen parser generator. SmaCC overcomes many of T-Gen’s limitations that make it difficult to produce parsers. SmaCC can generate parsers for ambiguous grammars and grammars with overlapping tokens."

      "Abstract": "Almost every programming language’s syntax includes a notion of binder and corresponding bound occurrences, along with the accompanying notions of alpha-equivalence, capture avoiding substitution, typing contexts, runtime environments, and so on. In the past, implementing and reasoning about programming languages required careful handling to maintain the correct behaviour of bound variables. Modern programming languages include features that enable constraints like scope safety to be expressed in types. Nevertheless, the programmer is still forced to write the same boilerplate over again for each new implementation of a scope safe operation (e.g., renaming, substitution, desugaring, printing, etc.), and then again for correctness proofs. We present an expressive universe of syntaxes with binding and demonstrate how to (1) implement scope safe traversals once and for all by generic programming; and (2) how to derive properties of these traversals by generic proving."

      "Abstract": "Although cybersecurity is becoming more and more central in every software development lifecycle, nowadays, developers often lack a precise understanding of the risk and impact of attacks. Discovering vulnerabilities in production environments is hard, but making developers aware of common vulnerabilities leads to more reliable software and an easier and more effective vulnerability assessment process. \nIn this work, we present an experience at the University of Genova aimed at spreading cybersecurity awareness among Computer Science and Computer Engineering students. During this experience, we found that practical, non-formal training had a substantial impact on cybersecurity awareness of the students that will become developers in the future."

      "Abstract": "In the last decade, ICT infrastructures for smart cities have become a reality and the number of projects affecting citizens’ lives is growing. In particular, the technology supporting civic participation is mature, although many systems do not reach the needed critical mass, as they are not able to capture the interest of their intended target. To overcome this difficulty, we describe a proposal for encouraging citizens’ participation by a reward mechanism based on a civic currency, powered by blockchain tokens, used to recognize civic engagement. This paper briefly sketches the main features of the system and discusses the development of its proof-of-concept in the context of a university course following an agile process."

      "Abstract": "Links is a web programming language under development in Edinburgh aimed at simplifying web development. Conventional multi-tier applications involve programming in several languages for different layers, and the mismatches between these layers and abstractions need to be handled by the programmer, which can lead to costly errors or security vulnerabilities. In Links, programs combine all of the code of a web application in a single program, and the implementation generates appropriate JavaScript and HTML for the client, and SQL queries for the database. \nLinks is freely available for anyone to use. However, installing and using Links is non-trivial, making it difficult for new programmers to get started and learn about Links. This paper reports on a Web-based ``TryLinks\" system, allowing anyone to experiment with Links without going through the installation process. TryLinks was designed with two major functionalities: an interactive Links shell that teaches the basic syntax of Links and acts as a playground, as well as a short tutorial series on how Links is used in practical web development. Tutorials can also be created or modified by administrators. \nWe present the design and implementation of TryLinks, and conclude with discussion of lessons learned from this project and remaining challenges for Web-based tutorials for Web programmin languages."

In this paper, we propose a case study of orchestrated crowdsourced testing of such a mobile web app, as an approach to face such challenges."

Several previous studies used bio-information such as brain activity to classify the inner-state of programmer without interruption. In this paper, we measure programmer’s brain waves while they comprehend the source code. In the experiment, we analyze difference of time-series brain wave features between success/failure for tasks that source code comprehension and bug judgement. The result of the experiment showed the participants who success source code understanding significantly increased power spectrum of α and β wave with the time passage."

      "Abstract": "A lot of developer work can be categorized as “more of the same”: tediously implementing almost-homogeneous, yet not-entirely-right functional specs, handed over by a veritable army of domain experts, in last year’s “favorite” enterprise platform. What if you could offload that work to those same domain experts, allowing them to write down actually-correct specs that can be run directly, now and in the future? After all, the best way to become a 10X programmer is to empower as many other people as possible. \nModel-driven software development and domain-specific languages (DSLs) can achieve exactly that. While low-code platforms force users to transmogrify their specifications into the language of that platform, DSLs are molded to fit the domain’s existing parlance and exact needs, at the same time giving your domain knowledge and assets a lifespan that exceeds that of the target platform du jour. \nTraditionally, implementing a DSL has been a complex task: you needed to know about parsing, integrating into an existing IDE, etc., even when using a language workbench. By now, the browser has become the most important client technology for applications, and it has become both desirable as well as feasible to implement DSLs with structured or projectional editing efficiently in the browser. This also does neatly away with the need to learn about parser technology. \nIn this talk, we’ll walk the listener through an implementation of a projectional, business-oriented DSL that’s small and simple, but plausibly real-life. We’ll use a stack consisting of JavaScript, React, and MobX to leverage Transparent Functional Reactive Programming (TFRP) as an architectural principle to be able to program more bang with fewer bits. \nAfter the talk, listeners will hopefully be convinced of the advantages of projectional DSLs, and of the feasibility of implementing one themselves in a limited amount of time."

      "Abstract": "Jupyter notebooks are used by data scientists to publish their research in an executable format. These notebooks are usually limited to a single programming language. Current polyglot notebooks extend this concept by allowing multiple languages per notebook, but this comes at the cost of having to externalize and to import data across languages. Our approach for polyglot notebooks is able to provide a more direct programming experience by executing notebooks on top of a polyglot execution environment, allowing each code cell to directly access foreign data structures and to call foreign functions and methods. We implemented this approach using GraalSqueak, a Squeak/Smalltalk implementation for the GraalVM. To prototype the programming experience and experiment with further polyglot tool support, we build a Squeak/Smalltalk-based notebook UI that is compatible with the Jupyter notebook file format. We evaluate PolyJuS by demonstrating an example polyglot notebook and discuss advantages and limitations of our approach."

The research in this area has focused mainly on the technical aspects of the creation of such views so far. However, we still lack answers to questions such as what properties of objects are considered important for these visualizations, whether all objects have an appropriate domain-specific view, or what clues could help us to construct these views fully automatically. In this paper, we describe an exploratory study where the participants were asked to inspect runtime states of objects displayed in a traditional debugger and draw ideal domain-specific views of these objects on paper. We describe interesting observations and findings obtained during this study and a preliminary taxonomy of these visualizations."

      "Abstract": "We believe that enabling services to collaborate, even if they were not designed to work together, will be important for the success of the Internet of Things (IoT). To support this, we have designed a domain specific language (DSL), called ComPOS, for gluing IoT services together. In this talk, we demonstrate ComPOS by building a system that helps spy on birds in gardens."

      "Abstract": "Product and engineering teams’ speed of producing high-quality results is critical to ensuring enterprise competitiveness. Additionally, one can observe an increase in IT systems complexity driven by the adoption of service-oriented architecture, micro-services, and serverless. Therefore, many large enterprises benefit from a mono-repository for source code management because of the improved team cognition that results from eroding barriers between teams and from influencing enhanced teamwork quality. This paper, first, reviews the characteristics of a multi-repositories structure, a monorepository structure, and a hybrid model. Second, it discusses why some manage source code in a multi-repositories structure, either by choice or because of the organic evolution of large enterprises. Third, it reviews how mono-repositories in large teams, beyond the technical arguments, can drive high efficiency and enhanced product quality through improved team cognition."

For systems of such devices, it must be possible to develop the system itself independently from its GUI(s). In this paper, we present an approach for developing GUIs towards already deployed, or “live”, service-based distributed systems without the need to write any additional program code (“glue code”). The results include development tools, and an implementation for the middleware framework PalCom and the mobile platform Android; they have been tested in several research projects and have been used for developing commercial products."

The computation part is often implemented in traditional programming code, and packaged as services, the other concerns might need to be created much later and by other people in separate organisations, or even by end users. In this paper we present the model used by the Palcom middleware where each of the concerns can be implemented separate, in separate representations, by separate people and yet combined and updated afterwards. The Palcom middleware is implemented in Java and in active use in research projects and in commercial products."

      "Abstract": "Today, there are many different programming languages and even more software libraries and frameworks for various use cases. Polyglot runtime environments such as GraalVM allow developers to build and extend applications using multiple languages, which gives them a much broader choice in terms of frameworks and libraries available for reuse. Nonetheless, some usability problems remain, for example with regard to passing data from one language to another. GraalVM provides language interoperability through its polyglot API and allows objects and messages to be passed across languages. From a developer perspective, however, it is sometimes unclear how to pass non-primitive objects from one language into a library or framework written in another language. Code from that other language may expect these objects to respond to a different set of messages, which they may not understand at all. \nIn this paper, we present polyglot adapters, an early-stage concept that helps to pass objects across different languages. We explain how these adapters can improve the polyglot programming experience and demonstrate this with a prototype for the GraalVM."

These languages include Ruby and Python, which rely on native extensions in order to execute code written in languages such as C/C++. To execute native extensions, we implemented Sulong, a LLVM IR interpreter that runs on Truffle and which is used in place of a native function interface in the GraalVM. This talk will give an overview of Sulong, how it is used within the GraalVM, and how it interacts with inline assembly code, compiler builtins, and the underlying operating system. \nBio: Manuel Rigger is a postdoctoral researcher, mentored by Hanspeter Mössenböck, at Johannes Kepler University Linz working on system security, software reliability, language implementation, and software-repository mining to uncover knowledge relevant for these areas. As part of his dissertation, he developed Sulong, a Truffle-based execution system for LLVM-based languages, which is used in place of a native function interface within GraalVM. From March 2019, he will work as a postdoctoral researcher, mentored by Zhendong Su, at ETH Zurich."

      "Abstract": "Live Typing automatically annotates variable types based on the objects assigned to them, and method return types based on the returned objects. IDEs can exploit this information to greatly improve the development tools and the programming experience, bringing some of the benefits of Static Typing tools to Dynamically Typed Languages. Live Typing benefits are boosted in Live Development Environments because the same VM is used to run the system under development and the IDE. Type information can be obtained from the running code no matter if that code is part of the language’s core, the development tools, or the system under development. The more code is run the more type info it will provide. For Live Typing to be usable, the VM has to collect the information as fast as possible, in objects that have to be accessed and configured from the development environment. This paper presents how the OpenSmalltalk-VM was modified to accomplish this task and the challenges we have for future versions."

      "Abstract": "The emphasis on energy efficient computing is steering hardware towards greater heterogeneity. Software must take advantage of emerging heterogeneous hardware to optimize for performance and efficiency. A question that arises is what is the right software layer to abstract the complexity of heterogeneous hardware? \nHistorically, the operating system (OS) is the first choice to abstract new hardware features. This benefits programmers, virtual machine developers, and language implementers, who do not need to worry about hardware details. On the other hand, the upper layers of the software stack, especially the language runtimes contain rich semantic information about user applications, unavailable to the OS. This information can be useful in better managing hardware. The drawback is that it requires changes to the runtime which makes hardware vendors depend on runtime developers. This paper discusses two case studies that show exposing hardware details to the Java runtime improves key evaluation metrics for popular Java applications. We further discuss implications for implementation complexity, programming model, and the necessary hardware and OS support."

      "Abstract": "Implementing language runtimes is simple in the ideal world: language specifications are combined with well-abstracted APIs and various approaches to code generation and optimization to form functional and efficient VMs, and multiple such VMs are in healthy competition to perform best in various well-defined scenarios. In the real world, things tend to be more interesting: languages lack specification (or don’t adhere to it), APIs expose implementation details in obvious and non-obvious ways, vast ecosystems need to be supported, and users have unexpected expectations on overall system behavior. This talk will show the experience gained from the language implementations that are part of the GraalVM multilingual runtime, in terms of how the understanding of the languages evolved over time (and what to look out for) and how some of the resulting technical challenges were solved by applying generic and GraalVM-specific solutions."

      "Abstract": "The HipHop Virtual Machine (HHVM) Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler uses a region-based compilation approach. Although region-based compilation has been employed in prior static and dynamic compilers, this approach has not been widely adopted by existing VMs, which typically use either trace-based or method-based compilation. In this talk, I’ll argue that region-based compilation is superior to both trace-based and method-based compilation in general. Furthermore, I’ll describe the key characteristics that make region-based compilation particularly attractive for dynamic-language VMs. After motivating the case for region-based compilation in VMs, I’ll describe the general architecture of the HHVM JIT compiler and how it integrates region-based compilation with a set of other key mechanisms, including type specialization, profile-guided optimizations, and on-stack replacement."

      "Abstract": "Language implementation frameworks such as RPython or Truffle help to build runtimes for dynamic languages. For this, they make certain design decisions and trade-offs upfront to make common language concepts easy to implement. Because of this, however, some language-specific concepts may be rather tedious to support, especially the modification of activation records. For example, Smalltalk provides reification of activations through context objects. Since they are used to implement other mechanisms such as exception handling on the language level, contexts need to be entirely supported by the underlying runtime. We present an approach for efficiently implementing Smalltalk context objects in frameworks that do not support unrestricted modification of activation records."

      "Abstract": "Developing parallel applications that exploit the hardware resources remains challenging. We tackle this issue for fork/join applications running on a single Java Virtual Machine (JVM) in a shared-memory multicore. An optimal fork/join application should maximize parallelism while minimizing overheads, and maximize locality while minimizing contention. Unfortunately, achieving these goals is challenging due to the complexity of tuning fork/join applications. As a result, fork/join applications often suffer from several performance issues such as excessive object creation and reclaiming, suboptimal forking, load imbalance, and inappropriate synchronization. In contrast to the extensive manual experimentation commonly required to properly tune fork/join applications, we devise a coaching tool able to automatically point developers to specific parts of such applications where performance problems originate and suggest concrete code modifications to fix them. Given the increasing popularity of fork/join parallelism on the JVM, many applications can benefit from our approach, including applications using standard Java APIs such as Streams and CompletableFuture."

Those frameworks either employ tracing-based or method- (or partial evaluation) based strategies, which have their own pros and cons. \nThis paper proposes an approach to enable both tracing- and method-based compilation so that the runtime can selectively apply an appropriate strategy to different parts of a program. \nThe proposal basically extends a meta-tracing compiler to method-based compilation by rolling back at conditional branches, trace-splitting at loop entries, and not following at function calls. \nAs a proof-of-concept, we implemented a tiny meta-tracing compiler in MinCaml by following the RPython’s architecture and extended it to support both tracing- and method-based compilation."

      "Abstract": "Shell scripting languages such as bash are designed to integrate with an OS, which mainly involves managing processes with implicit input and output streams. They also attempt to do this in a compact way that could be reasonably typed on a command-line interface. \nHowever, existing shell languages are not sufficient to serve as general-purpose languages—values are not observable except in raw streams of bytes, and they lack modern language features such as lexical scope and higher-order functions. \nBy way of a new programming language, Magritte, we propose a general-purpose programming language with semantics similar to bash. In this paper, we discuss the early design of such a system, in which the primary unit of composition, like bash, is processes with input and output channels, which can be read from or written to at any time, and which can be chained together via a pipe operator. We also explore concurrency semantics for such a language."

Various techniques are being used to enforce privacy, such as information flow control, symmetric/asymmetric cryptography secure computing enclaves, partial homomorphic encryption and differential privacy. These mechanisms should be ideally combined in complex software systems as they offer different properties and performance trade offs. Unfortunately, reasoning about the privacy properties of such combination is still an open research problem. \nIn this paper, we present our vision on a programming language in which we incorporate different privacy preservation techniques in a common programming model."

      "Abstract": "Energy-aware programming languages and frameworks seek to improve the energy efficiency of computer systems by taking advantage of application-specific information to perform energy optimizations. Effectively predicting an application’s energy behavior enables more powerful energy optimizations and additional energy management techniques. However, application energy consumption is fundamentally dynamic in nature, which limits the amount of effective energy prediction that can be done ahead of time. To address this challenge, we propose FJP, a predication-aware semantics that takes the estimation process online, and serves to partially predict a program’s energy consumption. FJP represents a first step towards improving the expressiveness of energy-aware language and framework techniques in its ability for online adaptive energy prediction."

A runtime memory access error will, at best, make your IoT device crash and reboot. We believe this makes them unattractive to programmers and therefore stifles IoT innovation. \nWe have designed Toit, a new software platform that turns IoT devices into ‘real’ robust computers: easy to program, safe execution environment, flexible, upgradable, and recoverable. This talk will first discuss why we had to implement a new programming language and then how Toit makes IoT devices accessible to high-level programmers. Finally, we will demonstrate how Toit can orchestrate a fleet of devices."

      "Abstract": "To prove properties about a Haskell function in Coq, we have to translate the Haskell function to Coq. Proofs about Haskell func- tions are performed in various levels of detail. For example, some- times proofs are performed as if Haskell were a total language and sometimes we are interested in explicitly reasoning about effects like partiality, exceptions or tracing. By translating a Haskell func- tion into a Coq function that is parametrised over a monad, we can model all these cases. Moreover, we can reuse function definitions for different kinds of proofs by instantiating the monadic function with a concrete monad instance. In order to model Haskell correctly, all arguments of constructors have to be made monadic as well. Due to technical restrictions in Coq we cannot define data types that are lifted this way. In previous work we have shown that we can use free monads and container representations to model effect-generic programs. That is, we can define a single Coq function that can be used to model no effects as well as effects like partiality, exceptions, and tracing. As an additional benefit by proving a proposition for all containers we can reuse propositions when considering different kinds of effects. While in previous work we have only considered equational propositions, in this work we are considering inequational proposi- tions. More precisely, we consider proofs that relate two Haskell terms with respect to some partial order that models the intuition of being “less or equally defined”. As an example, we consider the default implementation of Peano multiplication and an improved implementation with respect to “strictness”. Our contributions are more examples of using our orig- inal framework and the application to inequational propositions."

      "Abstract": "The World model is an existing functional input-output mechanism for event-driven programming. It is used in numerous popular textbooks and curricular settings. \nThe World model conflates two different tasks–the definition of an event processor and its execution–into one. This conflation imposes a significant (even unacceptable) burden on student users in several educational settings where we have tried to use it, e.g., for teaching physics. \nWhile it was tempting to pile on features to address these issues, we instead used the Scheme language design dictum of removing weaknesses that made them seem necessary. By separating the two tasks above, we arrived at a slightly different primitive, the reactor, as our basis. This only defines the event processor, and a variety of execution operators dictate how it runs. \nThe new design enables programmatic control over event-driven programs. This simplifies reflecting on program behavior, and eliminates many unnecessary curricular dependencies imposed by the old design. This work has been implemented in the Pyret programming language. The separation of concerns has enabled new curricula, such as the Bootstrap:Physics curriculum, to take flight. Thousands of students use this new mechanism every year. We believe that reducing impedance mismatches improves their educational experience."

      "Abstract": "The act and experience of programming is, at its heart, a fundamentally human activity that results in the production of artifacts. When considering programming, therefore, it would be a glaring omission to not involve people who specialize in studying artifacts and the human activity that yields them: archaeologists. Here we consider this with respect to computer games, the focus of archaeology’s nascent subarea of archaeogaming. \nOne type of archaeogaming research is digital excavation, a technical examination of the code and techniques used in old games’ implementation. We apply that in a case study of Entombed, an Atari 2600 game released in 1982 by US Games. The player in this game is, appropriately, an archaeologist who must make their way through a zombie-infested maze. Maze generation is a fruitful area for comparative retrogame archaeology, because a number of early games on different platforms featured mazes, and their variety of approaches can be compared. The maze in Entombed is particularly interesting: it is shaped in part by the extensive real-time constraints of the Atari 2600 platform, and also had to be generated efficiently and use next to no memory. We reverse engineered key areas of the game’s code to uncover its unusual maze-generation algorithm, which we have also built a reconstruction of, and analyzed the mysterious table that drives it. In addition, we discovered what appears to be a 35-year-old bug in the code, as well as direct evidence of code-reuse practices amongst game developers. \nWhat further makes this game’s development interesting is that, in an era where video games were typically solo projects, a total of five people were involved in various ways with Entombed. We piece together some of the backstory of the game’s development and intoxicant-fueled design using interviews to complement our technical work. \nFinally, we contextualize this example in archaeology and lay the groundwork for a broader interdisciplinary discussion about programming, one that includes both computer scientists and archaeologists."

      "Abstract": "There are different ways to check whether a program is “cor- rect”, including dynamic testing and static type checking. Unfortunately, testing only checks a certain (finite) set of inputs and types may be too imprecise to express complex correctness properties. For example, correctness of a sort- ing routine requires that the output is both sorted and con- tains the same elements as the input. Program verification aims to prove such correctness properties for all possible in- puts based on annotations such as pre-, postconditions, as- sertions and invariants. However, the verification process for these annotations can become complex. Therefore, sim- ple error messages may not be sufficient to help the pro- grammer understand and resolve verification issues."

      "Abstract": "This demonstration is intended for people interested in software documentation, and more specifically, in what can be achieved with a reflexive language, fully equipped for introspection. \nQuickref is a global documentation project for the Common Lisp Ecosystem. In a single function call, it builds an entire website containing reference manuals for almost two thousand Common Lisp libraries. The system is unintrusive: library authors do not have anything to do to make their code “Quickref aware”. A public website is maintained with the resulting full documentation, but individuals can also use Quickref to generate a local website, documenting only what is present on their machine. \nEach library is downloaded / updated, compiled, loaded, and introspected. From the collected information, a Texinfo file is generated, which is then processed into HTML. The advantage of Texinfo is that the documentation can be created in other formats than HTML (PDF, for example). \nThe generated documentation for a library contains the description of its structure (components, dependencies, packages etc.) and the provided definitions. Exported and internal definitions are listed separately, allowing the reader to have a quick view on the library’s public API. Definitions include constants, variables, symbol macros, macros, (setf) expanders, compiler macros, functions, generic functions and methods, method combinations, conditions, structures, classes and types. \nThe generated documentation includes every possible bit of information that introspection can provide: documentation strings, lambda lists (including qualifiers and specializers where appropriate), slots (including type, allocation and initialization arguments), definition source file etc. \nEvery documented item provides a full set of cross-references to related items: component dependencies, parents and children, classes direct methods, super and subclasses, slot readers and writers, setf expanders access and update functions etc. \nFinally, the documentation includes exhaustive and multiple-entry indexes for every documented item."

      "Abstract": "ParaSail is a language specifically designed to simplify the construction of programs that make full, safe use of parallel hardware even while manipulating potentially irregular data structures. As parallel hardware has proliferated, there has been an urgent need for languages that ease the writing of correct parallel programs. ParaSail achieves these goals largely through simplification of the language, rather than by adding numerous rules. In particular, ParaSail eliminates global variables, parameter aliasing, and most significantly, re-assignable pointers. ParaSail has adopted a pointer-free approach to defining complex data structures. Rather than using pointers, ParaSail supports flexible data structuring using expandable (and shrinkable) objects implemented using region-based storage management, along with generalized indexing. By eliminating global variables, parameter aliasing, and pointers, ParaSail reduces the complexity for the programmer, while still allowing ParaSail to provide flexible, pervasive, safe, parallel programming for irregular computations. Perhaps the most interesting discovery in this language development effort, based on over six years of use by the author and a group of ParaSail users, has been that it is possible to simultaneously simplify the language, support parallel programming with advanced data structures, and maintain flexibility and efficiency."

No prior experience with formal verification is assumed. \nIn general, program verification relies on source code annotations such as pre-, postconditions and invariants in order to check the program for correctness for all possible inputs. By specifying the expected behavior in terms of logical propositions, program verifiers can support dynamically-typed languages such as JavaScript (including dynamic programming idioms and higher-order functions). However, the verification process can become complex, so simple error messages may not be sufficient to explain verification problems. In this demo, I will present an integrated development and verification environment based on the JavaScript program verifier. In particular, I will use a series of small examples to illustrate how counterexamples, an interactive verification inspector and an integrated step-by-step debugger can be used to understand and debug verification issues."

      "Abstract": "Program comprehension concerns the ability of an individual to make an understanding of an existing software system to extend or transform it. Software systems comprise of data that are noisy and missing, which makes program understanding even more difficult. A software system consists of various views including the module dependency graph, execution logs, evolutionary information and the vocabulary used in the source code, that collectively defines the software system. Each of these views contain unique and complementary information; together which can more accurately describe the data. In this paper, we investigate various techniques for combining different sources of information to improve the performance of a program comprehension task. We employ state-of-the-art techniques from learning to 1) find a suitable similarity function for each view, and 2) compare different multi-view learning techniques to decompose a software system into high-level units and give component-level recommendations for refactoring of the system, as well as cross-view source code search. The experiments conducted on 10 relatively large Java software systems show that by fusing knowledge from different views, we can guarantee a lower bound on the quality of the modularization and even improve upon it. We proceed by integrating different sources of information to give a set of high-level recommendations as to how to refactor the software system. Furthermore, we demonstrate how learning a joint subspace allows for performing cross-modal retrieval across views, yielding results that are more aligned with what the user intends by the query. The multi-view approaches outlined in this paper can be employed for addressing problems in software engineering that can be encoded in terms of a learning problem, such as software bug prediction and feature location."

      "Abstract": "One Monad to Prove Them All is a modern fairy tale about curiosity and perseverance, two important properties of a successful PhD student. We follow the PhD student Mona on her adventure of proving properties about Haskell programs in the proof assistant Coq. \nOn the one hand, as a PhD student in computer science Mona observes an increasing demand for correct software products. In particular, because of the large amount of existing software, verifying existing software products becomes more important. Verifying programs in the functional programming language Haskell is no exception. On the other hand, Mona is delighted to see that communities in the area of theorem proving are becoming popular. Thus, Mona sets out to learn more about the interactive theorem prover Coq and verifying Haskell programs in Coq. \nTo prove properties about a Haskell function in Coq, Mona has to translate the function into Coq code. As Coq programs have to be total and Haskell programs are often not, Mona has to model partiality explicitly in Coq. In her quest for a solution Mona finds an ancient manuscript that explains how properties about Haskell functions can be proven in the proof assistant Agda by translating Haskell programs into monadic Agda programs. By instantiating the monadic program with a concrete monad instance the proof can be performed in either a total or a partial setting. Mona discovers that the proposed transformation does not work in Coq due to a restriction in the termination checker. In fact the transformation does not work in Agda anymore as well, as the termination checker in Agda has been improved. \nWe follow Mona on an educational journey through the land of functional programming where she learns about concepts like free monads and containers as well as basics and restrictions of proof assistants like Coq. These concepts are well-known individually, but their interplay gives rise to a solution for Mona’s problem based on the originally proposed monadic tranformation that has not been presented before. When Mona starts to test her approach by proving a statement about simple Haskell functions, she realizes that her approach has an additional advantage over the original idea in Agda. Mona’s final solution not only works for a specific monad instance but even allows her to prove monad-generic properties. Instead of proving properties over and over again for specific monad instances she is able to prove properties that hold for all monads representable by a container-based instance of the free monad. In order to strengthen her confidence in the practicability of her approach, Mona evaluates her approach in a case study that compares two implementations for queues. In order to share the results with other functional programmers the fairy tale is available as a literate Coq file. \nIf you are a citizen of the land of functional programming or are at least familiar with its customs, had a journey that involved reasoning about functional programs of your own, or are just a curious soul looking for the next story about monads and proofs, then this tale is for you."

In the upcoming Mars missions such robot, capable of traversing demanding terrain, repairing and operating mission equipment, assisting the astronauts or conducting research, can prove crucial for a successful outcome. Before planning any mission it is important to evaluate various solutions in order to choose the most reliable one. In order to satisfy this requirement, various rover competitions are being organised for students or professionals to participate in. The poster presents our solution for developing software of a rover which we are preparing for one of such competitions. It describes the system’s architecture, means of communication between various modules as well as with the operator and the way the autonomous mode is implemented. Our solutions and concepts may one day become an inspiration for engineers working on real rovers designed to operate on other planets."

      "Abstract": "Context. Embedded Domain-Specific Languages (EDSLs) are a common and widely used approach to DSLs in various languages, including Haskell and Scala. There are two main implementation techniques for EDSLs: shallow embeddings and deep embeddings. \nInquiry. Shallow embeddings are quite simple, but they have been criticized in the past for being quite limited in terms of modularity and reuse. In particular, it is often argued that supporting multiple DSL interpretations in shallow embeddings is difficult. \nApproach. This paper argues that shallow EDSLs and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are closely related. Gibbons and Wu already discussed the relationship between shallow EDSLs and procedural abstraction, while Cook discussed the connection between procedural abstraction and OOP. We make the transitive step in this paper by connecting shallow EDSLs directly to OOP via procedural abstraction. The knowledge about this relationship enables us to improve on implementation techniques for EDSLs. \nKnowledge. This paper argues that common OOP mechanisms (including inheritance, subtyping, and type-refinement) increase the modularity and reuse of shallow EDSLs when compared to classical procedural abstraction by enabling a simple way to express multiple, possibly dependent, interpretations. \nGrounding. We make our arguments by using Gibbons and Wu’s examples, where procedural abstraction is used in Haskell to model a simple shallow EDSL. We recode that EDSL in Scala and with an improved OO-inspired Haskell encoding. We further illustrate our approach with a case study on refactoring a deep external SQL query processor to make it more modular, shallow, and embedded. \nImportance. This work is important for two reasons. Firstly, from an intellectual point of view, this work establishes the connection between shallow embeddings and OOP, which enables a better understanding of both concepts. Secondly, this work illustrates programming techniques that can be used to improve the modularity and reuse of shallow EDSLs."

      "Abstract": "Graph-based data models allow for flexible data representation. In particular, semantic data based on RDF and OWL fuels use cases ranging from general knowledge graphs to domain specific knowledge in various technological or scientific domains. The flexibility of such approaches, however, makes programming with semantic data tedious and error-prone. In particular the logics-based data descriptions employed by OWL are problematic for existing error-detecting techniques, such as type systems. In this paper, we present DOTSpa, an advanced integration of semantic data into programming. We embed description logics, the logical foundations of OWL, into the type checking process of a statically typed programming language and provide typed data access through an embedding of the query language SPARQL. In addition, we demonstrate a concrete implementation of the approach, by extending the Scala programming language. We qualitatively compare programs using our approach to equivalent programs using a state-of-the-art library, in terms of how both frameworks aid users in the handling of typical failure scenarios."

      "Abstract": "Embedded software is growing fast in size and complexity, leading to intimate mixture of complex architectures and complex control. Consequently, software speci cation requires modeling both structures and behaviour of systems. Unfortunately, existing languages do not integrate these aspects well, usually prioritizing one of them. It is common to develop a separate language for each of these facets \nIn this paper, we contribute Clafer: a small language that attempts to tackle this challenge. It combines rich structural modeling with state of the art behavioural formalisms. We are not aware of any other modeling language that seamlessly combines these facets common to system and software modeling. \nWe show how Clafer, in a single unified syntax and semantics, allows capturing feature models (variability), component models, discrete control models (automata) and variability encompassing all these aspects. The language is built on top of first order logic with quantifiers over basic entities (for modeling structures) combined with linear temporal logic (for modeling behaviour). On top of this semantic foundation we build a simple but expressive syntax, enriched with carefully selected syntactic expansions that cover hierarchical modeling, associations, automata, scenarios, and Dwyer’s property patterns. \nWe evaluate Clafer using a power window case study, and comparing it against other notations that substantially overlap with its scope (SysML, AADL, Temporal OCL and Live Sequence Charts), discussing benefits and perils of using a single notation for the purpose."

      "Abstract": "Context: Trait composition has inspired new research in the area of code reuse for object oriented (OO) languages. One of the main advantages of this kind of composition is that it makes possible to separate subtyping from subclassing; which is good for code-reuse, design and reasoning. However, handling of state within traits is difficult, verbose or inelegant. \nInquiry: We identify the this-leaking problem as the fundamental limitation that prevents the separation of subtyping from subclassing in conventional OO languages. We explain that the concept of trait composition addresses this problem, by distinguishing code designed for use (as a type) from code designed for reuse (i.e. inherited). We are aware of at least 3 concrete independently designed research languages following this methodology: TraitRecordJ, Package Templates and DeepFJig. \nApproach: In this paper, we design 42µ, a new language, where we improve use and reuse and support the This type and family polymorphism by distinguishing code designed for use from code designed for reuse. In this way 42µ synthesise the 3 approaches above, and improves them with abstract state operations: a new elegant way to handle state composition in trait based languages. \nKnowledge and Grounding: Using case studies, we show that 42µ’s model of traits with abstract state operations is more usable and compact than prior work. We formalise our work and prove that type errors cannot arise from composing well typed code. \nImportance: This work is the logical core of the programming language 42. This shows that the ideas presented in this paper can be applicable to a full general purpose language. This form of composition is very flexible and could be used in many new languages."

Since then it has been used in various places to teach students about language implementation techniques and to do research on optimizations, tooling, and language features. \nThe Simple in the name was key to enabling much of this work. It allowed experimentation with various implementation languages as well as language implementation frameworks. It also enabled experiments with optimizations such as zero-overhead run-time metaprogramming, powerful metaobject protocols, efficient implementations of various concurrency models, and debuggers that can support all these features seamlessly. Even industry got curious about the Simple, and use SOM to showcase a framework for garbage collection and just-in-time compilation. \nThis talk is therefore a shameless plug for SOM, how it is used for research, and its potential for teaching. I’ll try to convince you that SOM, while being a small object-oriented language, is fully equipped to do cutting edge research. At the same time, I’ll argue that it is a great platform to teach language implementation techniques, good software engineering, and perhaps especially relevant for ‹Programming›: good programming practices."

      "Abstract": "Context. Recent studies show that developers spend most of their programming time testing, verifying and debugging software. As applications become more and more complex, developers demand more advanced debugging support to ease the software development process. \nInquiry. Since the 70’s many debugging solutions were introduced. Amongst them, online debuggers provide a good insight on the conditions that led to a bug, allowing inspection and interaction with the variables of the program. However, most of the online debugging solutions introduce \\textit{debugging interference} to the execution of the program, i.e. pauses, latency, and evaluation of code containing side-effects. \nApproach This paper investigates a novel debugging technique called \\outofplace debugging. The goal is to minimize the debugging interference characteristic of online debugging while allowing online remote capabilities. An \\outofplace debugger transfers the program execution and application state from the debugged application to the debugger application, both running in different processes. \nKnowledge. On the one hand, \\outofplace debugging allows developers to debug applications remotely, overcoming the need of physical access to the machine where the debugged application is running. On the other hand, debugging happens locally on the remote machine avoiding latency. That makes it suitable to be deployed on a distributed system and handle the debugging of several processes running in parallel. \nGrounding. We implemented a concrete out-of-place debugger for the Pharo Smalltalk programming language. We show that our approach is practical by performing several benchmarks, comparing our approach with a classic remote online debugger. We show that our prototype debugger outperforms by a 1000 times a traditional remote debugger in several scenarios. Moreover, we show that the presence of our debugger does not impact the overall performance of an application. \nImportance. This work combines remote debugging with the debugging experience of a local online debugger. Out-of-place debugging is the first online debugging technique that can minimize debugging interference while debugging a remote application. Yet, it still keeps the benefits of online debugging ( e.g. step-by-step execution). This makes the technique suitable for modern applications which are increasingly parallel, distributed and reactive to streams of data from various sources like sensors, UI, network, etc."

      "Abstract": "Multiparty session types (MST) are a well-established type theory that describes the interactive structure of a fixed number of components from a global point of view and type-checks the components through projection of the global type onto the participants of the session. They guarantee communicationsafety for a language of multiparty sessions (LMS), i.e., distributed, parallel components can exchange values without deadlocking and unexpected message types. \nSeveral variants of MST and LMS have been proposed to study key features of distributed and parallel programming. We observe that the population of the considered variants follows from only one ancestor, i.e. the original LMS/MST, and there are overlapping traits between features of the considered variants and the original. These hamper evolution of session types and languages and their adoption in practice. This paper addresses the following question: What are the essential features for MST and LMS, and how can these be modelled with simple constructs? To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this question has been addressed. \nWe performed a systematic analysis of the features and the constructs in MST, LMS, and the considered variants to identify the essential features. The variants are among the most influential (according to Google Scholar) and well-established systems that cover a wide set of areas in distributed, parallel programming. We used classical techniques of formal models such as BNF, structural congruence, small step operational semantics and typing judgments to build our language and type system. Lastly, the coherence of operational semantics and type system is proven by induction. \nThis paper proposes a set of essential features, a language of structured interactions and a type theory of comprehensive multiparty session types, including global types and type system. The analysis removes overlapping features and captures the shared traits, thereby introducing the essential features. The constructs of the language are simple and fundamental, based on the λ and π calculi. Analogously, our global types reflect what is omitted and introduced in the language. Our system covers all the features of the original and variants, with a better ratio of the number of language and type constructs over the number of covered features. \nThe features of the original, variants, and our system along with the number of constructs in the respective language and global types to model them are presented through a table. The syntax, operational semantics, meta-theory and type system of our system are given. We modelled all the motivating examples of the variants in our model, describing the reduction and typing steps. The work discusses how new features, in particular the non-essential ones (formerly excluded) and advanced ones can be either modelled atop the essential ones or added with minimal efforts, i.e. without modifying the existing ones. The fundamental properties of typed processes such as subject reduction, communication safety, and progress are established."

      "Abstract": "Various programming tools, languages, and environments give programmers the impression of changing a program while it is running. This experience of liveness has been discussed for over two decades and a broad spectrum of research on this topic exists. Amongst others, this work has been carried out in the communities around three major ideas which incorporate liveness as an important aspect: live programming, exploratory programming, and live coding. \nWhile there have been publications on the focus of each particular community, the overall spectrum of liveness across these three communities has not been investigated yet. Thus, we want to delineate the variety of research on liveness. At the same time, we want to investigate overlaps and differences in the values and contributions between the three communities. \nTherefore, we conducted a literature study with a sample of 212 publications on the terms retrieved from three major indexing services. On this sample, we conducted a thematic analysis regarding the following aspects: motivation for liveness, application domains, intended outcomes of running a system, and types of contributions. We also gathered bibliographic information such as related keywords and prominent publications. \nBesides other characteristics the results show that the field of exploratory programming is mostly about technical designs and empirical studies on tools for general-purpose programming. In contrast, publications on live coding have the most variety in their motivations and methodologies with a majority being empirical studies with users. As expected, most publications on live coding are applied to performance art. Finally, research on live programming is mostly motivated by making programming more accessible and easier to understand, evaluating their tool designs through empirical studies with users. \nIn delineating the spectrum of work on liveness, we hope to make the individual communities more aware of the work of the others. Further, by giving an overview of the values and methods of the individual communities, we hope to provide researchers new to the field of liveness with an initial overview."

      "Abstract": "When working on a program, developers traditionally have to simulate the behavior of the abstract code in their heads until they can execute the application. Live programming aims to support the development and comprehension of programs by providing more immediate feedback on program behavior, but the divide between code and behavior often remains. The goal of example-based live programming is to remove this gap by allowing programmers to explore the actual behavior of their code during development. This is achieved by defining live examples for parts of the application. \nThe idea of live examples has been already addressed in other tools and environments. However, most of those solutions are limited to specific domains and are suitable only for small programs. Thus, we aim to extend the application of example-based live programming to more complex programs potentially spanning multiple modules. \nWe investigate existing solutions to derive a set of requirements for an integration of live examples into source code. Based on these requirements we propose a new approach to live examples and present a prototype in its support. We reproduce, discuss, and extend scenarios from related work to show the practicality of our approach in the context of larger, more complicated, and with that also more realistic scenarios. Also, we measure and evaluate the system response time of our prototypical implementation. \nOur first results show that example-based live programming can provide more insights into the run-time behavior of parameterized code for non-trivial programs. They also reveal unsolved and new challenges affecting example-based live programming environments. In presenting this more general approach to example-based live programming, we hope to motivate further research into this area and to make practical solutions available."

In ScalaLoci, data flow between the components of the distributed system is specified explicitly (reactive approach). \nFirst, ScalaLoci provides “placement types” to associate data and computations to locations. Developers can control the placement by representing the different components of the distributed system at the type level. In contrast to existing multitier languages, our solution allows to go beyond the Web domain and the client–server model and enables static reasoning about placement. Second, we support “multitier reactives” – placed abstractions for reactive programming – which let developers compose data flows spanning over multiple distributed components."

      "Abstract": "Context: The term reactivity is popular in two areas of research: programming languages and distributed systems. On one hand, reactive programming is a paradigm which provides programmers with the means to declaratively write event-driven applications. On the other hand, reactive distributed systems handle client requests in a timely fashion regardless of load or failures. \nInquiry: Reactive programming languages and frameworks tailored to the implementation of distributed systems have previously been proposed. However, we argue that these approaches are ill fit to implement reactive distributed systems. \nApproach: We analyse state of the art runtimes for distributed reactive programming and identify two key issues with regards to reactive distributed systems. They rely on single, central points of coordination and/or assume a lack of partial failures in the systems they support. \nKnowledge: Based on our analysis we propose a novel runtime for distributed reactive programming languages and frameworks. This runtime supports reactive distributed systems by design. \nGrounding: We implement a proof of concept framework for reactive distributed systems in JavaScript which builds atop our runtime. Using this framework we implement a case study application which highlights the applicability of our approach. Moreover, we benchmark our runtime against a similar approach in order to showcase its runtime properties and we prove its correctness. \nImportance: This work aims to bridge the gap between two kinds of reactivity: reactive distributed systems and distributed reactive programming. Current distributed reactive programming approaches do not support reactive distributed systems. Our runtime is the first to bridge this reactivity gap: it allows for reactive distributed systems to be implemented using distributed reactive programming."

      "Abstract": "This demonstration presents a live programming environment for data structures called Kanon [1,2]. The goal of the environment is to support professional programmers when they develop new data structures and operations thereof. The key feature for data structures is its automatic visualization of objects that are created in a program execution. \nWe first overviews the environment through a coding session of a small data structure. The environment assumes a program is written in a test-driven style, and displays objects as a node-link diagram. We introduce the notion of visualization contexts, which the program state stopped at the cursor position, and used for navigating the visualization. \nWe then discusses the features that support liveness and data-structures. The jump-to-construction mechanism navigates the programmer from a visual element to a code fragment that made the element. Our proposed graph layout algorithm automatically analyzes the object structure and places nodes so as to help the programmers to recognize the relations between objects. An on-the-fly test case generation mechanism enables top-down programming by letting the programmers handcraft an expected result upon a call to an unimplemented function. \nLastly, we discuss several issues for future research. Programming complicated data structures require customized visualization so that the programmer can see the objects at different levels of abstraction. In order not to distract the programmers’ focus, it is crucial to handle errors appropriately especially in an environment where program code can be erroneous in the middle of editing. Our user experiment discovered some programming mistakes that can only be observed with the live programming environment, which might be an effect of live programming on the way of programming. \n \n[1] Oka, Masuhara and Aotani, “Live, synchronized, and mental map preserving visualization for data structure programming”, in Proceedings of Onward! 2018. \n[2] https://prg-titech.github.io/Kanon/"

      "Abstract": "Context: Meta programming consists for a large part of matching, analyzing, and transforming syntax trees. Many meta programming systems process abstract syntax trees, but this requires intimate knowledge of the structure of the data type describing the abstract syntax. As a result, meta programming is errorprone, and meta programs are not resilient to evolution of the structure of such ASTs, requiring invasive, fault-prone change to these programs. Inquiry: Concrete syntax patterns alleviate this problem by allowing the meta programmer to match and create syntax trees using the actual syntax of the object language. Systems supporting concrete syntax patterns, however, require a concrete grammar of the object language in their own formalism. Creating such grammars is a costly and error-prone process, especially for realistic languages such as Java and C++. Approach: In this paper we present Concretely, a technique to extend meta programming systems with pluggable concrete syntax patterns, based on external, black box parsers. We illustrate Concretely in the context of Rascal, an open-source meta programming system and language workbench, and show how to reuse existing parsers for Java, JavaScript, and C++. Furthermore, we propose Tympanic, a DSL to declaratively map external AST structures to Rascal’s internal data structures. Tympanic allows implementors of Concretely to solve the impedance mismatch between object-oriented class hierarchies in Java and Rascal’s algebraic data types. Both the algebraic data type and AST marshalling code is automatically generated. Knowledge: The conceptual architecture of Concretely and Tympanic supports the reuse of pre-existing, external parsers, and their AST representation in meta programming systems that feature concrete syntax patterns for matching and constructing syntax trees. As such this opens up concrete syntax pattern matching for a host of realistic languages for which writing a grammar from scratch is time consuming and error-prone, but for which industry-strength parsers exist in the wild. Grounding: We evaluate Concretely in terms of source lines of code (SLOC), relative to the size of the AST data type and marshalling code. We show that for real programming languages such as C++ and Java, adding support for concrete syntax patterns takes an effort only in the order of dozens of SLOC. Similarly, we evaluate Tympanic in terms of SLOC, showing an order of magnitude of reduction in SLOC compared to manual implementation of the AST data types and marshalling code. Importance: Meta programming has applications in reverse engineering, reengineering, source code analysis, static analysis, software renovation, domain-specific language engineering, and many others. Processing of syntax trees is central to all of these tasks. Concrete syntax patterns improve the practice of constructing meta programs. The combination of Concretely and Tympanic has the potential to make concrete syntax patterns available with very little effort, thereby improving and promoting the application of meta programming in the general software engineering context."

      "Abstract": "This demonstration shows a code pattern mining toolchain being developed as part of the INTiMALS research project. This project’s goal is to research and deploy novel pattern mining algorithms in an industrial prototype of an intelligent modernisation assistant for legacy software systems. Ultimately, the assistant should pro-actively recommend software engineers source code modernisation actions by comparing their current development efforts with insights gained by treating source code repositories as data. The current toolchain allows to mine for previously unknown patterns in the system’s source code to reveal programming idioms, structural code regularities and coding conventions. This is done in a language-independent manner and we have already succesfully mined Java and COBOL code. Discovered patterns and their matches can then be interactively explored in a graphical pattern browser. \nIn the demo, we will first give a brief overview of the toolchain and how it allows for language parametricity. This is followed by diving in to a typical pattern exploration session, applied to the Java language and using JHotdraw as an example system. We will discuss how the pattern miner can be parametrized to reveal different kinds of patterns. Then we will interactively explore the results of mining and show how the pattern browser allows us to get an understanding of the patterns found by the miner. \nThe intended audience is programmers interested in seeing how mining can help them find patterns in their source, as well as pattern mining experts that wish to see a novel application and customization of pattern mining techniques."

      "Abstract": "Salon des Refusés (“exhibition of rejects”) was an 1863 exhibition of artworks rejected from the official Paris Salon. The jury of Paris Salon required near-photographic realism and classified works according to a strict genre hierarchy. Paintings by many, later famous, modernists such as Édouard Manet were rejected and appeared in what became known as the Salon des Refusés. This workshop is the programming language research equivalent of Salon des Refusés. We provide venue for exploring new ideas and new ways of doing computer science. \nMany interesting ideas about programming might struggle to find space in the modern programming language research community, often because they are difficult to evaluate using established evaluation methods (be it proofs, measurements or controlled user studies). As a result, they are often seen as “unscientific”. Rather than requiring detailed evaluation, this workshop provides a venue where interesting and thought provoking ideas can be exposed to critical evaluation. Submissions that provoke interesting discussion among the program committee members will be published together with an attributed review that presents an alternative position, develops additional context or summarizes discussion from the workshop. This means of engaging with papers enables explorations of novel programming ideas and new ways of doing computer science. \nTopics of interest \nThe scope of the workshop is determined more by the format of submissions than by the specific area of programming language or computer science research that we are interested in. We welcome submissions in a format that makes it possible to think about programming in a new way, including, but not limited to: \n \n Thought experiments – we believe that thought experiments, analogies and illustrative metaphors can provide novel insights and inspire fruitful programming language ideas. \n Experimentation – we find prejudices in favour of theory, as far back as there is institutionalized science, but programming can often be seen more as experimentation than as theorizing. We welcome interesting experiments even if there is yet no overarching theory that explains why they happened. \n Paradigms – all scientific work is rooted in a scientific paradigm that frame what questions can be asked. We encourage submissions that reflect on existing paradigms or explore alternative scientific paradigms. \n Metaphors, myths and analogies – any description of formal, mathematical, quantitative or even poetical nature still represents just an analogy. We believe that fruitful ideas can be learned from less common forms of analogies as well as from the predominant, formal and mathematical ones. \n From jokes to science fiction – a story or an artistic performance may explore ideas and spark conversations that provide crucial inspiration for development of new computer science thinking. \n (Counter-)Histories – we are inspired by the idea that our field may currently be in its pre-history, and that the practices we have adopted may be completely faulty. A counter-history may report on today’s primitive notions of programming from the far future, or on the unfulfilled promise of programming’s past. \n Ironies of Software Design – the ‘best practices’ of programming are motivated by math and engineering virtues such as consistency, correctness, and efficiency. These virtues may not be apparent to other communities involved with software, or may go directly against their needs. We invite reports on the ironic consequences of virtuous programming, and the ironic successes of ‘improper’ programming. \n Dialogues – the orthodoxies of programming ought to be challenged from outside the field, from the point of view of those that are affected by or excluded from it. We invite both insiders and outsiders to submit critical dialogues on programming. \n \nSubmission format and important dates \nWe welcome short papers (up to 3000 words) and long papers (up to 9000 words) as well as screencasts or interactive essays. We intend to publish accepted paper on the web, but any format is welcome for the submission (authors can use the ‹Programming› paper template). We intend to consider publishing post-proceedings using the ACM SIGPLAN format (acmart format with the sigconf option), so you can use this template for your submission too. \n \n Deadline for submissions: January 7 2019 extended to January 21st 2019 \n Notification of authors: January 23 2019 February 6th 2019 \n Early registration deadline: February 25 2019 \n Workshop at  2019: April 2 2019 \n Workshop website here and submission link here. \n \nYou can find additional information about the program committee and papers and critiques from previous editions of the workshop here.",

For that, please download and read all submissions in advance. \nAbstract \nImagine a software development task: some sort of requirements and perhaps a platform and programming language. A group of developers head into a vast workroom. As they design, debate and program they discover they need learn more about the domain and the nature of potential solutions–they are exploring via programming. \nThe Programming Experience (PX) Workshop is about what happens in that room when programmers sit down in front of computers and produce code, especially in an exploratory way. Do they create text that is transformed into running behavior (the old way), or do they operate on behavior directly (“liveness”); are they exploring the live domain to understand the true nature of the requirements; are they like authors creating new worlds; does visualization matter; is the experience immediate, immersive, vivid and continuous; do fluency, literacy, and learning matter; do they build tools, meta-tools; are they creating languages to express new concepts quickly and easily; and curiously, is joy relevant to the experience? \nHere is a list of topic areas to get you thinking: \n \n creating programs \n experience of programming \n exploratory programming \n liveness \n non-standard tools \n visual, auditory, tactile, and other non-textual languages \n text and more than text \n program understanding \n domain-specific languages \n psychology of programming \n error tolerance \n user studies \n \nCorrectness, performance, standard tools, foundations, and text-as-program are important traditional research areas, but the experience of programming and how to improve and evolve it are the focus of this workshop. In this edition we would like to focus on exploratory, live programming, but we also welcome a wide spectrum of contributions on programming experience. \nPrevious editions \nPX/18 at \u0026lt;Programming\u0026gt; 2018, April 10, 2018, Nice, France \nPX/17.2 at SPLASH 2017, October 22, 2017, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada \nPX/17 at \u0026lt;Programming\u0026gt; 2017, April 4, 2017, Brussels, Belgium \nPX/16 at ECOOP 2016, July 18, 2016, Rome, Italy \nFlyer \nhttp://programming-experience.org/px19/media/PX19CfP.pdf \nhttp://programming-experience.org/px19/",

      "Abstract": "Salon des Refusés (“exhibition of rejects”) was an 1863 exhibition of artworks rejected from the official Paris Salon. The jury of Paris Salon required near-photographic realism and classified works according to a strict genre hierarchy. Paintings by many, later famous, modernists such as Édouard Manet were rejected and appeared in what became known as the Salon des Refusés. This workshop is the programming language research equivalent of Salon des Refusés. We provide venue for exploring new ideas and new ways of doing computer science. \nMany interesting ideas about programming might struggle to find space in the modern programming language research community, often because they are difficult to evaluate using established evaluation methods (be it proofs, measurements or controlled user studies). As a result, they are often seen as “unscientific”. Rather than requiring detailed evaluation, this workshop provides a venue where interesting and thought provoking ideas can be exposed to critical evaluation. Submissions that provoke interesting discussion among the program committee members will be published together with an attributed review that presents an alternative position, develops additional context or summarizes discussion from the workshop. This means of engaging with papers enables explorations of novel programming ideas and new ways of doing computer science. \nTopics of interest \nThe scope of the workshop is determined more by the format of submissions than by the specific area of programming language or computer science research that we are interested in. We welcome submissions in a format that makes it possible to think about programming in a new way, including, but not limited to: \n \n Thought experiments – we believe that thought experiments, analogies and illustrative metaphors can provide novel insights and inspire fruitful programming language ideas. \n Experimentation – we find prejudices in favour of theory, as far back as there is institutionalized science, but programming can often be seen more as experimentation than as theorizing. We welcome interesting experiments even if there is yet no overarching theory that explains why they happened. \n Paradigms – all scientific work is rooted in a scientific paradigm that frame what questions can be asked.

Such environment leverage web-based resources to automatically generate and recommend established programming rules and patterns; they also enable architects to explicitly specify such patterns to be enforced during development. \nI have (co)authored over 100 scientific publications in renowned publication venues in software engineering and programming languages. I regularly serve on steering committees, program committees, and editorial boards of top tier conferences and journals in software engineering and programming languages.",

Our team will keep a broad horizon to maintain a sustainable development environment.

His main research interests are multi-paradigm approaches to genericity and performance. \nDidier Verna is the president of the European Lisp Symposium steering committee and serves as a program committee member in various conferences (International Lisp Conference, European Lisp Symposium, Dynamic Languages Symposium, ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, Context-Oriented Programming workshop etc. ). \nDidier Verna is also quite involved in free software: he was one of the core maintainers of XEmacs for more than 15 years, a contributor to Gnus and BBDB, and an occasional contributor to other Free Software projects (the GNU Autotools most notably; he was one of the technical reviewers for the “Goat Book”). He is the author of several LaTeX packages and Common Lisp libraries. \nAll of this is in fact half-true: two days a week, Didier Verna drops his scientific hat and wears the semi-professional Jazz musician one instead. He also is a certified Aikido teacher, and gives coaching sessions on the theme “Aikido and Conflict Management” for large companies.",

Joe serves as president of the board of The Hillside Group, a group dedicated to improving the quality of life of everyone who uses, builds, and encounters software systems. He is best known as an author of the Big Ball of Mud pattern, which illuminates many fallacies in software architecture. Joe teaches and mentors developers on agile and lean practices, architecture, building flexible systems, clean design, patterns, refactoring, and testing. Joe thinks software is still too hard to change. He wants to do something about this and believes that you can start solving this problem through the use of best practices (patterns) and by putting the ability to change software into the hands of the people with the knowledge to change it. \nJoe has recently been innovating, collecting and writing on the best practices and patterns on Being Agile at Quality. During this time he has given presentations, workshops, and keynotes at various conferences and in industrial settings. He has published (and continues writing and collecting) over two dozen patterns on this topic. Joe have also been working with organizations on the best practices for Agile Quality Assurance, helping them apply these techniques, and has shepherded Agile Experience reports on the topic. Variations of this some of this material has been presented as talks and workshop/tutorials at various conferences (Agile, JDD in Poland, SugarLoaf PLoP, Agile Portugal, AgileBrazil, YOW! in Australia, Saturn, and Israel Conference on Software Architecture) and to some of Joe’s clients. In 2015 Joe won the New Directions award with a colleague at Saturn 2015, given to the presentation that best describes innovative new approaches and thought leadership in the application of architecture-centric practices for his presentation QA to AQ: Shifting from Quality Assurance to Agile Quality (see here).",

He is building programming tools that integrate with modern data sources (open government data, data published by citizen initiatives) and let users easily create analyses and visualizations that are linked to the original data source, making the analyses more transparent, reproducible, but also easy to adapt. His early work on the project can be found at http://thegamma.net. \nTomas’ many other interests include open-source and functional programming (he is an active contributor to the F# ecosystem), programming language theory (his PhD thesis on “coeffects” develops a theory of context-aware programming language language), but also understanding programming through the perspective of philosophy of science.",

She has a MA from School of Creative Media, City University of Hong Kong and a MSc from Institute of Digital Art and Technology, Plymouth University in UK, and 10 years experience as a programmer, designer, information architect and project manager in both corporate and educational settings. She has recently completed a PhD at the Center for Participatory IT (School of Communication and Culture), Aarhus University with the topic titled “Executing Liveness: An examination of code inter-actions in software (art) practice”. She has awarded the Top-Ranked LABS Abstracts 2017 by Leonardo and the winner of The 2018 Aarhus University Research Foundation PhD award. Currently, she is Assistant Professor at the Department of Digital Design and Information Studies in Aarhus University, teaching Aesthetic Programming and Digital Culture. \nInformed by the cultural, social and political context of technology, Winnie’s work approach spans the fields of artistic practice, media art, software studies, cultural studies and computer science, examining the materiality of computational processes that underwrite our experiences and realities in digital culture via artistic and/or coding practice. Her works explore themes/concepts around digital culture, specifically concerning internet censorship, images politics, data circulation, real-time processing/liveness, the culture of code practice, etc. Her projects and lectures have been presented internationally at museums, art festivals, universities and conferences, including but not limited to ZKM, Transmediale2015/2017 (Berlin), Electronic Literature Festival2018, ISEA2015/2016 (Vancouver, Hong Kong), V\u0026amp;A Museum (London), ARoS Aarhus Art Museum (Aarhus, Denmark), Si Shang Art Museum (Beijing), Pulse Art + Technology Festival (Savannah, USA), FutureEverything Art Exhibition (Manchester), The Wrong – New Digital Art Biennale, Hong Kong Microwave International Media Arts Festival, Taipei National University of Arts, Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design and The University of Hong Kong. \nWinnie’s current research focuses on Exploratory and Aesthetic Programming for arts and humanities, working on two books titled “Aesthetic Programming: A Handbook of Software Studies, or Software Studies for Dummies” (with Geoff Cox) and “Fix My Code” (with Cornelia Sollfrank).",
